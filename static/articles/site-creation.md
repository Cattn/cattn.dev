# Why I created this site
> Why did I do it??

I created this site as a home to all of my project, as well as to host information about me!

## Technologies involved
- Svelte
- NodeJS
- TypeScript
- Markdown

## Challenges I faced throughout the project
- A major challenge I have faced through the creation of this project was the blog system. I wanted to design my own system for loading blogs written in markdown as html components in svelte. This is so I could easily translate my Obsidian notes and other markdown features to html.
