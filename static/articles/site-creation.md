# Why I created this site
> Why did I do it??

I created this site as a home to all of my project, as well as to host information about me!

## Technologies involved
- Svelte
- NodeJS
- TypeScript
- Markdown

## Challenges I faced throughout the project
- One major challenge I had with this project, is I'm pretty bad at styling components, and actually piecing things together with CSS.  This project was an excuse for me to get very familiar with everything possible with tailwind, and get my information down.

- Another major challenge I had was coming up with a blog system. I went for a markdown approach where the articles are imported as markdown, then loaded as html.
