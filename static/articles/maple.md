## What's this project?
Maple is a music library and organization tool. It allows you to upload your music library and watch it be organized into albums, artists, playlists, and more! You are given robust controls to play and organize your music. It also includes server-side & social features, such as discord RPC integration, friends, statuses, and in the future: playlist transfers & other P2P functions.

## Small history
Building a good solution for a local music library has always fascinated me. Even my earliest projects had a fascination with library management & music playback.

## Ok, so what's special about Maple?
One of the main issues I've had with similar apps is the lack of good social features, and convenience. Maple is an attempt to solve both of those issues.

### Social Features
While still being built up, Maple already provides a quick way to checkup on your friends most recent track, and put out your own listening history. There's plenty of room to expand on this, such as with built in stat-tracking, which is something [I already love...](https://stats.fm/catt)

### Convenience
I find that I personally have a local music library on all of my devices, and that it's not extremely large in file-size. So one of the main annoyances with existing solutions, such as jellyfin, is the high "cost" of setup, and the need to centralize my music immediately. This centralization offers almost no benefits to someone like me, as it just requires more steps to import or download music, making the entire process *slow*. 

Maple is my attempt to solve these problems. The setup/onboarding process is near **zero.** You select a folder, hit import, wait for it to process, and you're done. Need to add more music? Just select more music and hit import. No need to maintain or organize a library with tons of folders, self-host a service (if you don't want), or expose your device to the internet (or setup tailscale). It just **works**.

### *how are you supposed to sync your library??*
Currently? you don't! However, the future update for Maple including PeerJS support will address this. In just two buttons you'll be able to transfer your entire library from device-to-device, or to a friend. Fully P2P.
