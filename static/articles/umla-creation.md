# UMLA

## What's this project?
This is UMLA/Maple, a local library first music platform. This is a website meant to help you use, organize, and enjoy your own music!

## What's the inspiration behind it?
I was inspired to make this through many times in my life, such as being on a plane with no internet. Where I had my music, but found my local tools to play it lacking. For example, windows media player, etc. So this project is not only to solve that issue forever. But to help me learn.
